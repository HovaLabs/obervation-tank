# Observation Tank

Tired of staring at dashboards during on-call shifts? Let Observation Tank make on call more fun — your endpoints swim as fish, and when something goes down, you'll know when fish go belly up.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

Configure your endpoints at `/config` or import them via CSV (See public/TEMPLATE_ENDPOINT_IMPORT.csv).

You can click on fish in the tank to see what URL they represent and click them again to remove the URL.
